## Contentstack Management Python SDK

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. All you have to do is build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/).

This SDK uses the [Content Management API](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/) (CMA). The CMA is used to manage the content of your Contentstack account. This includes creating, updating, deleting, and fetching content of your account. To use the CMA, you will need to authenticate your users with a [Management Token](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-tokens/about-management-tokens) or an [Authtoken](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/#how-to-get-authtoken). Read more about it in [Authentication](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/#authentication).

Note: By using CMA, you can execute GET requests for fetching content. However, we strongly recommend that you always use the [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-delivery-api/) to deliver content to your web or mobile properties.

### Prerequisite

You will need python 3 installed on your machine. You can install it
from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-macosx10.9.pkg).

### Installation
#### Install contentstack pip

```python
pip install contentstack_management
```
To import the SDK, use the following command:
```python
from contentstack_management import contentstack

client = contentstack.ContentstackClient()
```

### Authentication
To use this SDK, you need to authenticate your users by using the Authtoken, credentials, or Management Token (stack-level token).
### Authtoken

An **Authtoken** is a read-write token used to make authorized CMA requests, and it is a **user-specific** token.
```python
client = contentstack.ContentstackClient(authtoken= 'authtoken')
```
### Login
To Login to Contentstack by using credentials, you can use the following lines of code:
```python
client.login(email="email", password="password")

```

### Management Token
**Management Tokens** are **stack-level** tokens, with no users attached to them.

```python
result = client.stack(api_key = 'api_key', management_token= 'management_token' ).content_type('content_type_uid')
.fetch().json()
print(result)
```
### Contentstack Management Python SDK: 5-minute Quickstart
#### Initializing Your SDK:
To use the Python CMA SDK, you need to first initialize it. To do this, use the following code:

```python
from contentstack_management import contentstack

client = contentstack.ContentstackClient(authtoken= 'authtoken')
```
#### Fetch Stack Detail
Use the following lines of code to fetch your stack detail using this SDK:
```python
result = client.stack(api_key= 'api_key').fetch().json()
print(result)
```

#### Create Entry
To create an entry in a specific content type of a stack, use the following lines of code:

```python
entry  = {
  title: 'Sample Entry',
  url: '/sampleEntry'
}

result = client.stack(api_key= 'api_key').content_types('content_type_uid').entry().create(entry)
print(result.json())
```

#### Create Asset
The following lines of code can be used to upload assets to your stack:

```python
asset  = {
   upload: 'path/to/file',
   title: 'Asset Title'
}
asset = client().stack(api_key='api_key').assets()
result = asset.upload(asset)
```
